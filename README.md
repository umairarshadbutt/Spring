# Spring Framework [![Build Status](https://ci.spring.io/api/v1/teams/spring-framework/pipelines/spring-framework-5.3.x/jobs/build/badge)](https://ci.spring.io/teams/spring-framework/pipelines/spring-framework-5.3.x?groups=Build")

This is the home of the Spring Framework: the foundation for all [Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects). Collectively the Spring Framework and the family of Spring projects are often referred to simply as "Spring". 

Spring provides everything required beyond the Java programming language for creating enterprise applications for a wide range of scenarios and architectures. Please read the [Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction) section as reference for a more complete introduction.

## Documentation

The Spring Framework maintains reference documentation ([published](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/) and [source](src/docs/asciidoc)), Github [wiki pages](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki), and an
[API reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/). There are also [guides and tutorials](https://spring.io/guides) across Spring projects.
